This program can compile, and it works fine with grocery part of the program.

- In the nutrition part of the program, the "SCAN FOOD ITEM" button can only work once in the program.
  I had a reset method comment out in the GroceryCart.java, since I cannot make it work properly.
- As you refill the cart, the measure variable will still keep the that it had before.
